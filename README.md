**Directory Structure:**

* **`src/`**: Contains the project source code.
* **`exe/`**: Contains the executable files and Python scripts.

**Usage:**

* **Single Generation:** Run the executable file directly to perform a single map generation. The result will be visualized by `draw.py`.
* **Performance Test:** Run `benchmark.py` to conduct a continuous generation test (benchmark) without visualization.
